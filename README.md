# newsletter
Newsletter sign-up form with success message
the challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

Add their email and submit the form
See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
See form validation messages if:
The field is left empty
The email address is not formatted correctly
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
